# RFI-detection-with-Mask-RCNN
This project is a software capable of detecting radio frecuency interference, present in spectrograms, using the Mask RCNN framework to do the detection and AWS for storage and processing. This software was developed to assist the Chineese-argentinian Radio Telescope (CART)  http://cart.unsj.edu.ar/proyecto.php
