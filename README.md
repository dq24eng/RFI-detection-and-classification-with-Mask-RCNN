# RFI Detection with Mask-RCNN
This project is a software capable of detecting and classifying radio frecuency interference, present in spectrograms. The software uses the Mask RCNN framework (https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) to do the detection and clasification of RFI and AWS EC2 servers for storage and processing. This software was developed to assist the Chineese-argentinian Radio Telescope (CART)  (http://cart.unsj.edu.ar/proyecto.php) located in San Juan - Argentina.
